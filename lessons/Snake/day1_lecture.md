Lecture notes: snake day 1
==

Intro (before canvas task)
--
* brief intro to the game
* who knows about pixels
* if you want something to display on the screen, what are the tools you have now? (HTML elements)
* do you know a way to draw an arbitrary shape on the screen using HTML elements?
* you can do it with canvas (all we'll do today is rectangles)

break for 'canvas basics' task (draw_block)
--

Game state
--
* everybody should try snake for a minute so they all know how it works
* what information do you need to know to draw the game? (ignore the apples for now. block positions and snake direction)
* how would you represent it? (once we settle on a way, everyone fills in the JS on their copy)

break for 'draw gamestate' task
--

Snake propagation
--
* everyone should take a few minutes to try and figure this out on their own
* anyone who came up with something usable should try it, give the rest a default method

At this point, the snake should be crawling across the screen horizontally. Anyone who finishes early can move on to keystroke response and wall collisions.
