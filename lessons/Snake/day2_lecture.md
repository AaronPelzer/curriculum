Lecture notes: snake day 2
==

## Review of day 1
Get them to talk about:
 0. What's stored in gamestate
 0. How is the snake position updated

## The switch statement
Do a show of hands at the beginning to make sure everyone understands how to use the switch statement. If not, take 10 minutes to explain it. (Make sure to cover case, default, break).

## Key input
* Have everyone copy and paste the key input skeleton into their projects (day2_skeleton.htm)
* Run the file and have them hit keys and watch the console input. Have everyone create cases for down, left and right which log the name of the direction. (Up is already in there).
* Have everyone modify their switch cases to modify gamestate.direction. This may take some experimentation for them to get right.

## Hit-testing (walls)

## Apple generator
