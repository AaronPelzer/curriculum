####Snake Lesson

#####Objectives
Functions and program structure:
Students who independently write the draw_block and update_snake functions may learn something about separation of concerns. But kids who don't understand the basics of defining vs calling a function will be lost

Arrays:
Writing the snake update function requires basic array skills. Students who write update_snake on their own (there may not be any) are doing very well. Even the kids who need help with the algorithm but can implement it on their own are at the effective or extremely qualified level.

Loops/events:
Students who can finish the 'challenge' version of day 1 (write the program structure from scratch) have a deep understanding of how code is called and reused.

Page content:
Students will learn basic methods on the canvas tag.

Wireframing:
Learning to paint the game state may improve wireframing skills.
