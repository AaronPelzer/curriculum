Snake lesson
==

Snake is a simple video game that has existed for decades, with implementations available for most platforms. In this lesson, Scripted students will start with skeleton code and flesh out a snake game that works in the browser. This lesson doesn't aim to teach 'speccing' skills -- we'll define and limit each step of the exercise.

## Objectives
### Day 1
Write functions to:
* draw a block on the canvas
* paint the game from a gamestate object
* update the gamestate to make the snake move in a direction

### Day 2
* key input and the switch statement
* hit-testing for walls
* apple generator

### Day 3
* hit-testing for apples
* grow snake when an apple hits
* hit-testing for self-intersection
* catch-up for anyone who's behind
* add levels for anyone who's ahead (this step is unstructured, students should figure it out on their own)

## Rubric skills learned
* Functions and program structure: students who independently write the draw_block and update_snake functions may learn something about separation of concerns. But kids who don't understand the basics of defining vs calling a function will be lost.
* Arrays: writing the snake update function requires basic array skills. Students who write update_snake on their own (there may not be any) are doing very well. Even the kids who need help with the algorithm but can implement it on their own are at the effective or extremely qualified level.
* Page content: students will learn basic methods on the canvas tag.
* Wireframing: learning to paint the game state may improve wireframing skills.
