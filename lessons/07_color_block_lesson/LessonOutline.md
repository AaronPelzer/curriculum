### Lesson 7: Color Block Project

**Reminder** Don't for get to have the kids log their attendance at scripted.org/attendance !

**Review** In the last assignment, the students created About me webpages to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.  Students may also learned about version control and published their first websites.

**Goal** In this lesson, students will practice using Divs, IDs and Elements on a webpage.  They will also learning about nesting Divs.

###Do Now:

Students do now should be to create a new file called "ColorBlock.html". They should then add in all of the necessary parts to a webpage - head and body.

###Review:
Review Elements, IDs, and Classes.  What are the differences between them? How to we reference each in our CSS files?  Show how to target elements by:

1. element type (div, p, img, etc.)
2. class (.className)
3. id (#idName)



###Excercise:

Walk students through a live coding excercise of this web page.  Explain the different parts of the page as indicated in the attachment and have students code along with you.

Please note -- it might be easier to add the style into the HTML file itself.  If you prefer, you can also try using jsbin.com instead to show the students the result of the page. If you're going to do this, their do-now should be in JSBin rather than in their text editors.
