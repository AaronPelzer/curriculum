### HTML Review

Let's recall what we know about HTML.
* What does "HTML" stand for?
* What is its purpose? (Structure and content, not the looks of the page.)
* Syntax: angle brackets, opening-closing or self-closing tags, attributes.
* Examples:

   Tag | Meaning
   -------------------------|----------------
   `<html>, <head>, <body>` | basic structure
    `<p>` | paragraph
    `<a src="URL">` | link
    `<img src="URL" />` | image
