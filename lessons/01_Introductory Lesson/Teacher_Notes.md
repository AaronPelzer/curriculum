Students are required to log-in to class whenever they attend.

- Classes will be held twice a week. 
- Students will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- The point of the club is to prepare students for internships with technology firms over the summer.
- Not all students will be selected for internships.  Students must complete projects and achieve mastery over certain skills on rubric (distribute rubric for students to review).
- It's important for students to take this seriously and not miss class. Their class participation will effect their Hackathon scores.
- Explain to students that we will have an end of semester hackathon on December 14th. During the hackathon, students will compete in teams against other schools for prizes.
- Introduce yourself to the students. Tell them a little about your background -- students love to hear about you!
