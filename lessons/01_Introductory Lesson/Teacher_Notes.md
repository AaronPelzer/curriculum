###ScriptEd Lesson 1: Introduction

#####Introduction (15 Minutes) 
During your first lesson with the students you should introduce them to ScriptEd.  

Ask all students to sign in using the following link:

http://www.scripted.org/attendance.html

Students are required to log-in to class whenever they attend.

- Classes will be held twice a week. 
- Students will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- The point of the club is to prepare students for internships with technology firms over the summer. Students have interened at About.com, Thrillist and Content.ly, and we'll be in even more companies this summer.
- Not all students will be selected for internships.  Students must attend class and work hard if they want to be selected.
- It's important for students to take this seriously and not miss class. Their class participation will effect their Hackathon scores.
- Explain to students that we will have an end of semester hackathon on May 17th (tentative). During the hackathon, students will compete in teams against other schools for prizes.  Here are some example of previous hackathon projects (Please show these to the students!): [Harlem Shake](http://scriptednyc.github.io/Hackathon/harlemshake/shake.html), [Color Block](http://scriptednyc.github.io/Hackathon/colorblock/block.html), [Memory](http://scriptednyc.github.io/Hackathon/memory/memory.html), [Chimney Run] (http://jsbin.com/uyoDufe/15), [Brooklyn-opoly](http://jsbin.com/aQOQEMOY/2/edit)
- Introduce yourself to the students. Tell them a little about your background -- students love to hear about you!

#####Intro. to CS: Processing on Khan Academy (45 minutes)

You will guide the students through a lesson in Khan Academy. The first part of the lesson asks the students to draw a smiley face on a piece of paper, and then write down the steps they took to draw the smiley face.  The lead instructor should then ask the students to explain the steps, and try to draw a smiley face on the board.  The point of this excercise is to show students the ambiguity of natural language, and that it is important to always give a computer precise instructions when writing code.  The computer will do whatever you tell it to do.



Open this presentation and guide students through this exercise.
